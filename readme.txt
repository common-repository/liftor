== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Liftor work with my theme? =

It should work with any theme, I tested it with the default theme "Twenty Nineteen" & Astra theme.

= Will Liftor work with Divi builder? =

Nope, It's specifically for Elementor theme builder, the shortcodes should work with any theme/builder tho.

= Is this plugin enough to customize the whole lesson template =

You'll need the other [shortcodes from LifterLMS's docs](https://lifterlms.com/docs/shortcodes) and you're good to go with building your lesson template.

= Do I need to have the pro version of Elementor to customize the Lesson template globally? =

The theme builder of Elementor is included in the pro version, so yes you need to have the pro version to edit the lesson template globally.

= Will you add more shortcodes? =

Yes! I'm working on more shortcodes for LifterLMS's elements to cover all the custom fields of LifterLMS.
